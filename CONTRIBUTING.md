## Before you start... ✋

Use a personal fork and not an organization's fork, we will routinely modify your PR, whether it's a quick rebase or to
take care of any minor nitpicks we might have. Often, it's better for us to solve these problems for you than make you
go back and forth trying to fix it yourself.

Unfortunately, if you use an organization for your PR, it prevents Paper from modifying it. This requires us to manually
merge your PR, resulting in us closing the PR instead of marking it as merged.

We much prefer to have PRs show as merged, so please do not use repositories on organizations for PRs.

See <https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1681> for more information on the issue.

## Let's get you prepared... 🤞

### You're gonna need following 'stuff' before you actually start contributing.
