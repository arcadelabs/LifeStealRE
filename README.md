<h2 align="center">About LifeSteal++</h2>
Lifesteal is a survival gamemode concept made by some MCYT content creators, when you kill someone, you get to keep their 1x max health attribute or as we like to call it, a life, and vice versa. Players can also craft consumable heart items with a custom recipe or withdraw it. In addition to the traditional Lifesteal concept, our plugin adds tons of other features, such as 3 different types of hearts, blessed, normal and cursed. It also adds the option to drop random or fixed types of hearts on withdraw, death and craft. You can create unlimited amounts of hearts in all 3 types, each of them is 100% customizable, and each heart can give unique effects as well.

## Final thoughts,
This is my ([@RealRONiN](https://github.com/RealRONiN)'s) 2nd public project (first one is Greetings and it's private for god knows what reasons.), 
and it's still in development, I'd say it's about 40% done for now, please report any bugs or issues you face in issues section.
For developers who're reviewing the code right now (on my humble request I'm guessing), please don't yell at me for forgetting to add null checks and other important stuff in almost everywhere, also please don't judge my obsession with gradients in configs.
